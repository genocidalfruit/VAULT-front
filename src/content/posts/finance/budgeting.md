# üí∞ Personal Budgeting

A budget is a plan for how you'll spend your money each month. It helps you track income and expenses, reach financial goals, and avoid overspending. Here's how to create and maintain an effective budget.

## üéØ Why Budget?

### Financial Benefits
- **Control spending**: Know where your money goes
- **Reach goals**: Save for specific objectives
- **Reduce stress**: Eliminate money worries
- **Build wealth**: Consistent saving and investing
- **Prepare for emergencies**: Build financial cushion

### Peace of Mind
- No more wondering if you can afford something
- Confidence in financial decisions
- Better sleep knowing you're on track
- Reduced arguments about money
- Clear path to financial freedom

## üìä Budgeting Methods

### 50/30/20 Rule
**Simple percentage-based approach**:
- **50% Needs**: Housing, utilities, groceries, minimum debt payments
- **30% Wants**: Entertainment, dining out, hobbies, subscriptions
- **20% Savings**: Emergency fund, retirement, debt payoff

**Example with $5,000 monthly income**:
- Needs: $2,500
- Wants: $1,500
- Savings: $1,000

### Zero-Based Budget
**Every dollar has a purpose**:
- Income minus expenses equals zero
- Assign every dollar to a category
- More detailed than 50/30/20
- Better for people who want complete control

### Envelope Method
**Cash-based system**:
- Put cash in envelopes for each category
- When envelope is empty, you're done spending
- Great for controlling discretionary spending
- Can be done digitally with apps

### Pay Yourself First
**Savings-focused approach**:
- Save/invest first, before any spending
- Automate transfers to savings
- Live on what's left
