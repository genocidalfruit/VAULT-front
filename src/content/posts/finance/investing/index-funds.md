# üìà Index Fund Investing

Index funds are a type of mutual fund or ETF designed to track the performance of a specific market index. They offer a simple, low-cost way to invest in the stock market and build long-term wealth.

## üéØ What Are Index Funds?

### Basic Concept
Index funds are **passively managed** investments that:
- Track a specific market index (like the S&P 500)
- Hold the same stocks in the same proportions as the index
- Aim to match (not beat) the index's performance
- Require minimal management

### Popular Indexes
**S&P 500**: 500 largest US companies
**Total Stock Market**: Entire US stock market
**FTSE Developed Markets**: International developed countries
**Emerging Markets**: Developing countries
**Bond Index**: Government and corporate bonds

## üí∞ Benefits of Index Investing

### Low Costs
**Expense ratios** typically 0.03% - 0.20%
- Compare to actively managed funds: 0.5% - 2.0%
- Lower fees mean more money stays invested
- Compound effect over time is significant

### Diversification
**Instant diversification**:
- S&P 500 fund = ownership in 500 companies
- Reduces risk of individual stock picking
- Spreads risk across sectors and companies
- Geographic diversification with international funds

### Simplicity
**Easy to understand and manage**:
- No need to research individual stocks
- No timing the market required
- Automatic rebalancing
- Set-and-forget investing

### Historical Performance
**Long-term track record**:
- S&P 500 has averaged ~10% annually over decades
- Beats most actively managed funds over time
- Consistent with market returns
- No manager risk

## üèóÔ∏è Building a Portfolio

### Three-Fund Portfolio
**Simple and effective approach**:
1. **Total Stock Market Index** (60-70%)
2. **International Stock Index** (20-30%)
3. **Bond Index** (10-20%)

### Target Date Funds
**All-in-one solution**:
- Automatically adjusts allocation based on retirement date
- Becomes more conservative as you age
- Perfect for beginners
- Single fund simplicity

### Asset Allocation by Age
**Rule of thumb**: Bond percentage = your age
- **Age 25**: 75% stocks, 25% bonds
- **Age 40**: 60% stocks, 40% bonds
- **Age 60**: 40% stocks, 60% bonds

*Note: Many experts now suggest more aggressive allocations*
