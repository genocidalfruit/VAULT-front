# üì∏ Photography Basics

Photography is the art of capturing light and moments in time. Whether you're using a smartphone or a professional camera, understanding basic principles will dramatically improve your photos.

## üìê Composition Fundamentals

### Rule of Thirds
**Divide your frame into nine equal sections**:
- Place subjects along the lines or at intersections
- Horizons on the upper or lower third line
- Creates more dynamic, interesting compositions
- Most cameras have grid lines to help

### Leading Lines
**Use lines to guide the viewer's eye**:
- Roads, rivers, fences, architectural elements
- Diagonal lines create energy and movement
- Curved lines add grace and flow
- Converging lines create depth

### Framing
**Use elements to frame your subject**:
- Tree branches, doorways, windows
- Creates depth and focuses attention
- Adds context to your subject
- Can hide distracting elements

### Symmetry and Patterns
**Look for repeating elements or perfect balance**:
- Reflections in water
- Architectural details
- Natural patterns
- Break patterns for impact

## üí° Understanding Light

### Golden Hour
**Best natural light occurs**:
- First hour after sunrise
- Last hour before sunset
- Soft, warm, flattering light
- Long shadows add dimension

### Blue Hour
**Twilight photography**:
- 20-30 minutes after sunset
- Deep blue sky with artificial lights
- Perfect for cityscapes
- Balanced exposure between sky and lights

### Direction of Light
**Front lighting**: Even but can be flat
**Side lighting**: Creates depth and texture
**Back lighting**: Dramatic silhouettes and rim lighting
**Diffused lighting**: Soft shadows, even exposure

### Quality of Light
**Hard light**: Direct sun, harsh shadows, high contrast
**Soft light**: Cloudy days, shade, diffused sources
**Color temperature**: Warm (sunset) vs. cool (shade)

## üì∑ Camera Settings

### Exposure Triangle
**Three elements control exposure**:

**Aperture (f-stop)**:
- Controls depth of field
- Lower f-numbers = wider aperture = shallow depth
- Higher f-numbers = smaller aperture = deep depth
- f/1.4-f/2.8: Portraits, low light
- f/8-f/11: Landscapes, group photos

**Shutter Speed**:
- Controls motion blur
- Fast speeds (1/500s+): Freeze action
- Slow speeds (1/60s-): Motion blur, camera shake risk
- Very slow (1s+): Light trails, smooth water

**ISO**:
- Controls sensor sensitivity
- Lower ISO (100-400): Less noise, better quality
- Higher ISO (800+): More noise, better for low light
- Modern cameras handle high ISO better

### Camera Modes
**Auto**: Camera makes all decisions
**Program (P)**: Camera chooses aperture/shutter, you control ISO
**Aperture Priority (A/Av)**: You set aperture, camera sets shutter
**Shutter Priority (S/Tv)**: You set shutter, camera sets aperture
**Manual (M)**: You control everything

### Focus Modes
**Single-point AF**: You choose exact focus point
**Zone AF**: Camera focuses within selected area
**Wide-area AF**: Camera chooses from all points
**Continuous AF**: Tracks moving subjects
**Manual focus**: You control focus ring

## üéØ Photography Genres

### Portrait Photography
**Tips for better portraits**:
- Focus on the eyes
- Use wide apertures (f/1.4-f/2.8)
- Consider background carefully
- Communicate with your subject
- Try different angles and distances

**Lighting for portraits**:
- Avoid harsh midday sun
- Use window light indoors
- Consider reflectors to fill shadows
- Watch for unflattering shadows

### Landscape Photography
**Essential techniques**:
- Use tripod for sharp images
- Shoot in RAW format
- Focus stacking for maximum sharpness
- Use graduated neutral density filters
- Plan shots with apps like PhotoPills

**Composition tips**:
- Include foreground, middle ground, background
- Use wide-angle lenses carefully
- Don't always center the horizon
- Look for leading lines in nature

### Street Photography
**Capturing life in public**:
- Be respectful and aware of local laws
- Use smaller, less conspicuous cameras
- Learn to anticipate moments
- Practice zone focusing
- Shoot in burst mode for action

### Macro Photography
**Close-up details**:
- Use macro lenses or close-up filters
- Shallow depth of field is common
- Focus stacking for sharp details
- Watch for camera shake
- Consider focus rails for precision

## üì± Smartphone Photography

### Maximizing Phone Cameras
**Technical tips**:
- Clean your lens regularly
- Use HDR mode for high contrast scenes
- Try portrait mode for background blur
- Shoot in RAW if available
- Use manual camera apps for more control

**Composition still matters**:
- All composition rules apply
- Use grid lines in camera app
- Get closer to your subjects
- Try different angles and perspectives
- Don't rely only on digital zoom

### Phone Photography Accessories
**Useful additions**:
- Tripod with phone mount
- External lenses (wide, macro, telephoto)
- Portable LED lights
- Reflectors and diffusers
- Remote shutter releases

## üé® Post-Processing Basics

### RAW vs. JPEG
**RAW advantages**:
- More editing flexibility
- Better recovery of highlights/shadows
- Non-destructive editing
- Higher quality output

**JPEG advantages**:
- Smaller file sizes
- Ready to share immediately
- Less storage space needed
- Faster camera performance

### Essential Edits
**Global adjustments**:
- Exposure correction
- Highlight and shadow recovery
- Contrast and clarity
- Color temperature and tint
- Vibrance and saturation

**Local adjustments**:
- Graduated filters for skies
- Radial filters for emphasis
- Masking for specific areas
- Brush adjustments for details

### Popular Software
**Beginner-friendly**:
- Adobe Lightroom
- Luminar
- Skylum Aurora HDR
- Apple Photos
- Google Photos

**Advanced options**:
- Adobe Photoshop
- Capture One
- Affinity Photo
- GIMP (free)
