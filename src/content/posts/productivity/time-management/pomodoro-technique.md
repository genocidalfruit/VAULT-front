# üçÖ Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

## ‚è∞ How It Works

### The Basic Process
1. **Choose a task** you want to work on
2. **Set a timer** for 25 minutes (one "pomodoro")
3. **Work on the task** until the timer rings
4. **Take a short break** (5 minutes)
5. **Repeat** the process
6. After 4 pomodoros, take a **longer break** (15-30 minutes)
