# ‚úÖ Getting Things Done (GTD)

Getting Things Done (GTD) is a personal productivity system developed by David Allen. It's based on the principle of moving planned tasks and projects out of the mind by recording them externally and breaking them into actionable work items.

## üß† Core Principles

### Mind Like Water
- Keep your mind clear and focused
- Don't rely on memory for task management
- Capture everything in a trusted system

### Two-Minute Rule
If something takes less than two minutes to complete, do it immediately rather than adding it to your system.

## üìã The Five Steps

### 1. Capture
Collect everything that has your attention:
- Use inboxes (physical and digital)
- Write down all tasks, ideas, and commitments
- Don't judge or organize yet, just capture

### 2. Clarify
Process what you've captured:
- Is it actionable?
- If yes, what's the next action?
- If no, trash it, incubate it, or file it for reference

### 3. Organize
Put items in the right places:
- **Next Actions**: Specific, physical actions
- **Projects**: Outcomes requiring multiple steps
- **Waiting For**: Items you're waiting on from others
- **Someday/Maybe**: Things you might want to do later

### 4. Reflect
Review your system regularly:
- Daily: Check calendar and next actions
- Weekly: Review all lists and projects
- Monthly: Review goals and priorities

### 5. Engage
Take action with confidence:
- Trust your system
- Choose actions based on context, time, and energy
- Focus on one thing at a time

## üìÅ Key Lists

### Next Actions
- Specific, concrete actions you can take
- Organized by context (@calls, @computer, @errands)
- Always start with a verb

### Projects
- Any outcome requiring more than one action
- Review weekly to ensure progress
- Each project needs at least one next action

### Waiting For
- Track what you're waiting for from others
- Include who and when you asked
- Review regularly and follow up

### Someday/Maybe
- Ideas and projects for the future
- Review during weekly reviews
- Move items to active projects when ready

## üîÑ Weekly Review

The weekly review is crucial for GTD success:

### Review Process
1. **Collect** loose papers and materials
2. **Process** your inboxes to zero
3. **Review** your calendar for the past and coming weeks
4. **Review** your action lists
5. **Review** your projects list
6. **Review** your Someday/Maybe list
