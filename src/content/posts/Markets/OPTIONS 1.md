# 📈 Types of Options

This section introduces different kinds of financial options, specifically call and put options, and their basic mechanics.

## ⬆️ Call Option
A call option is a "contract" that allows the bearer to buy a share at a set price as specified in the contract.
- The bearer buys the option itself for a certain price
- The option "contract" then allows the bearer to buy shares at the price specified in the option contract
For profit using a call option, the stock value has to go up so you can buy the shares at a reduced price while selling it at the listed price to make a profit per share.

## ⬇️ Put Option
A put option is similar to call option but it involves selling the share at a certain specified rate.
For profit, the stock value has to go down so you can buy the stock at the listed price and sell it at an increased price to make a profit per share.

# 📝 Terms

This section defines key terminology associated with options contracts, such as strike price and ask price.

- **Strike Price -** The price at which the option values the share at
- **Ask Price -** Price of the option

**==OPTIONS CONTRACTS ARE PER 100 SHARES==**
If the contract says 80 cents, it means per option, but when you buy the contract you are buying it for 100 shares so you buy it for 80 dollars.
